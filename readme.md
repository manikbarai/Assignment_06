1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Answer: 
 Var: A var variable is scoped to the function it’s declared in, or globally if declared outside any function.
 Let :A let variable is limited to the block of code where it’s defined, such as inside a loop or conditional.
 Const: A const variable also has block scope, and once assigned, its value can’t be reassigned.

 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
 Answer:
 map(): map() goes through every element of an array and creates a new array with the results.
 forEach(): forEach() also goes through every element, but it doesn’t return a new array
 filter() :filter() checks every element against a condition and gives you a new array with only the elements that pass that condition.
